# Facial Expression Recognition in Keras
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained in Keras to recongnise facial expressions. The trained model is then served to a web interface and performs real-time facial expression recognition on video and image data. The objective is to classify each face based on the emotion shown in the facial expression into one of the seven categories:<br>
<ul>
  <li> Angry </li>
  <li> Disgust </li>
  <li> Fear </li>
  <li> Happy </li>
  <li> Sad </li>
  <li> Surprise </li>
  <li> Neutral </li>
</ul>
