# Facial Expression Recognition in Keras
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained in Keras to recongnise facial expressions. OpenCV is used to automatically detect faces in images and draw bounding boxes around them. The trained model is then served to a web interface using Flask, and performs real-time facial expression recognition on video and image data. The objective is to classify each face based on the emotion shown in the facial expression into one of the seven categories:<br>
<ul>
  <li> Angry </li>
  <li> Disgust </li>
  <li> Fear </li>
  <li> Happy </li>
  <li> Sad </li>
  <li> Surprise </li>
  <li> Neutral </li>
</ul>
